1. Generate a new SSH key
Run this command (replace your_email@example.com with your GitHub email):

bash

Edit
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
When it asks for a file location, just press Enter to accept the default (/Users/your_user/.ssh/id_rsa).

When it asks for a passphrase, you can either enter one or leave it empty and press Enter twice.

2. Start the SSH agent
bash

Edit
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
3. Add your SSH private key to the agent
bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
4. Copy your SSH public key to clipboard
On macOS:

bash
Copy
Edit
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
If pbcopy is not available, just run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
and manually copy the output.

5. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account
Go to https://github.com/settings/keys

Click New SSH key

Paste your public key into the key box

Give it a name (e.g. "My MacBook Air")

Click Add SSH key
